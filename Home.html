    <h2 id="elle"><i><u>About me</u></i></h2>

    I'm Laura, I'm 25 years old and I live in Bergamo, Italy. <br>
    One of my greatest passions is to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit different places in the world since I was a child. <br>
    By traveling, I was able to come into contact with cultural and social realities different from mine. <br> 
    This has allowed me to become a very open-minded person, always ready to know what is foreign to me. <br>

    <h2 id="elle"><i><u>My Stregths</u></i></h2>

    I am a very sociable person and I work well within a team. I always listen carefully and with respect to the opinions of others, with the ultimate goal of achieving the best possible team result. <br>
    I'm not afraid to throw myself into new challenges, even though they are completely unknown to me.
